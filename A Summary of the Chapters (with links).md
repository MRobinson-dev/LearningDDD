# Part I. Strategic Design
*There is no sense in talking about the solution before we agree on the problem, and no sense talking about the implementation steps before we agree on the solution. ~ Efrat Goldratt-Ashlag

# Part II. Tactical Design
-   [Chapter 5](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch05.html#implementing_simple_business_logic) starts the discussion of business logic implementation patterns with two patterns addressing the cases of simple business logic.
    
-   [Chapter 6](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch06.html#tackling_complex_business_logic) advances from simple to complex business logic and introduces the domain model pattern for tackling its complexity.
    
-   [Chapter 7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch07.html#modeling_the_dimension_of_time) adds the perspective of time and introduces an even more advanced way to model and implement business logic: the event-sourced domain model.
    
-   [Chapter 8](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch08.html#architectural_patterns-id000006) shifts the focus to a higher level and describes three architectural patterns for structuring components.
    
-   [Chapter 9](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch09.html#communication_patterns) provides the patterns needed to orchestrate the work of the system’s components.

# Part III. Applying Domain-Driven Design in Practice
-   [Chapter 10](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch10.html#design_heuristics) ties together the patterns discussed in the earlier chapters into a number of simple rules of thumb that streamline the process of making design decisions.
    
-   [Chapter 11](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch11.html#evolving_design_decisions) explores software design from the perspective of time and how it is supposed to change and evolve through its lifespan.
    
-   [Chapter 12](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch12.html#event_storming-id000068) introduces EventStorming: a low-tech workshop for effectively sharing knowledge, building shared understanding, and designing software.
    
-   [Chapter 13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch13.html#domain_driven_design_in_the_real_world) addresses the difficulties you may face when introducing domain-driven design to brownfield projects.

# Part IV. Relationships to Other Methodologies and Patterns
-   [Chapter 14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch14.html#microservices) discusses the relationship between the microservices architectural style and domain-driven design: where they differ and where they complement each other.
    
-   [Chapter 15](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch15.html#event_driven_architectur) explores domain-driven design patterns and tools in the context of the event-driven architecture.
    
-   [Chapter 16](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch16.html#data_mesh-id000059) shifts the discussion from operational systems to analytical data management systems and discusses the interplay between domain-driven design and the data mesh architecture.
