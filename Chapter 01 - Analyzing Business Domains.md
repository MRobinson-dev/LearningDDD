## Terminology:
**Business Domain** - A company's main area of activity.  The service or product the comapny provides to its clients.   
*note - a company can operate in multiple business domains*

**Subdomain** - A fine-grained area of business activity that does not contribute to the profitability of the company but is necessary for the business to operate.  There are 3 types of subdomains:  Core, Generic and Supporting.   

**Core Subdomain (aka Core Domain)**  - Business Activities that support the business and are a source of competitive advantage.  This is something a company does differently from its competitors,  is hard for a competitor to copy or imitate the company's solution and therefore has complexity.
*Example:  Google Search - this is not a paid service but the search engine is an important component of the Google Ads product*

**Generic Subdomain** - Business Activites that support the business and all companies are performing in the same way.
*Example: An online retail platform used by many companies*

**Supporting Subdomains** - Business Activites that support the business, are not generic but also do not provide any competitive advantage
